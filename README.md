## 📌 Overview

Healthcare decisions are often delayed because patients can't judge how serious their symptoms are. Some wait too long for critical conditions, while others panic and rush to hospitals unnecessarily.

*SymptoSense* is an AI-driven assistant that helps users:

* 🧾 Input their symptoms
* 🧠 Get possible conditions (non-diagnostic)
* 📊 Receive a severity score: *🔴 Critical | 🟠 Moderate | 🟢 Mild*
* ✅ Know the right next step: Emergency → Doctor Visit → Home Care

---

## 🔑 Key Features

* 🧠 *AI + Rule-Based Analysis* – safer and smarter than standard symptom checkers
* 📊 *Severity Scoring* – tells you when to worry and when not to
* 🌍 *Accessibility* – simple UI with future multilingual support
* 🔒 *Privacy-First* – user health data stays secure
* 📱 *Cross-Platform Ready* – Web app now, mobile app next

---
